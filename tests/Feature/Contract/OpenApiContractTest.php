/**
 * Behavioural assertions about the committed openapi.json, as distinct from the byte-equality
 * gate in bin/check-openapi.sh.
 *
 * The byte gate protects the document's STABILITY, not its TRUTH. It asks only whether the
 * committed bytes match a fresh generation, so any defect the generator reproduces passes it
 * for ever - and worse, the standard response to "openapi.json is out of date" is
 * `make openapi && git add openapi.json`, which commits whatever the generator now produces.
 * One line vanishing from a 225-line generated file is easy to wave through.
 *
 * Both facts below shipped broken-but-green exactly that way, which is why they are asserted
 * behaviourally and derived from the rules rather than restated as literals: a test that
 * hardcodes what the document should say is just a second copy of the document.
